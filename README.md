bunch of tools i use for maths. I code most of the things i learn and find interesting.
the code is not the best, or the fastest, as they're typically written jankily - just to get them done.
most are hooked up to matplotlib as the real goal is just the pretty pictures.

Note that vectors_tool, the largest file, for linear algebra, is often outdated and not tested thouroughly as i regularly change it on my machine without changing it here.
the same goes for most files, they are modified regularly depending on what it's used for but not often updated, or checked.

Most files are also incomplete, or almost completely non-functionoal (e.g. mappings tool), as they are just the skeleton of a file which will become much larger when 
i have time to make them

the names of the files are hopefully self-explanatory, as well as the docstrings, but here's a list of what they do:

imaginary_numbers_and_logs and imaginary_tools are for complex number representation, and can do a bit of maths (e.g. multiplying or inverting)
list_tools was some terrible code i wrote when first getting to grips with python, that just does a lot of stuff with lists,
matrix_tools grew out of list_tools, and is the subset relating to matrices
vector_tool was initially used for gram-schmidt orthogonalisation as i was doing that at the time, but then used vectors to deal with matrices, and yadda yadda.
mappings_tool is a backbone of a project i'm going to eventually do for abstract algebra in python.
